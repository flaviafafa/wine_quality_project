# wine_quality_project

In this project, we applied and evaluated multiple regression and classification methods in predicting red and white wine quality from physicochemical properties. We compared the efficiency of the chosen methods by test accuracy, Area Under Curve (AUC), and mean absolute error (MAE) from repeated 5-fold cross-validation.

This was the final group project for the STSCI4740 Data Mining and Machine Learning course in the fall of 2023. The group was made up of Flavia Jiang and Chunyu Wu, making equal contributions to the project.
